# RM-Tools: Software to analyse Faraday rotation

Python scripts to perform RM-synthesis, RM-clean and QU-fitting
onpolarised radio spectra.

**IMPORTANT:** the actively developed RM-tools directory has moved.
RM-tools can now be found at

[https://github.com/CIRADA-Tools/RM](https://github.com/CIRADA-Tools/RM)

Further development of RM-tools will take place in that repository, so
all feature requests, bug reports, and other communication should be
done there.  This repository will no longer be updated. The main
branch contains the last update of the Python 2 version of RM-tools,
while the CIRADA branch contains the Python 3 version as of May 2019.

RMtools_1D  ... 1D utilities to analyse Faraday spectra.
RMtools_3D  ... 1D utilities to analyse Faraday spectral cubes.
RMutils     ... Core functions used by the analysis utilities.


**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The master and develop branches of RM-tools are no
longer being actively maintained.  The cirada branch has been updated
to Python 3; the master branch has been left for Python 2
compatability but will not receive updates except for critial bugs (at
our discretion).  The most recent version of the cirada branch can be
found at the new repository linked above.

Questions, bug reports, and feature requests can be sent to Cameron
Van Eck, cameron.van.eck (at) dunlap.utoronto.ca.
